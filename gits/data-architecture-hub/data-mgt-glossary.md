<summary id="data-element:axa-group-dm">**Data Element** - Source: `AXA Metadata & Data Quality Terms and Classifications v0.5`</summary>
<p>A data element is a fundamental, conceptual unit of data. Often, the terms ""variable"" and ""field"" are used synonymously to mean a data element (e.g. Individual Contract Status, Claim Event Date and Employee First Name).
A data element is comprised of three components: a data object, a property, and a value domain.
The data object is the idea, person or thing that is of interest and is being described (e.g. the Customer).
The property is the characteristic of the data object that is of interest (e.g. the Preferred Language).
The value domain establishes the permissible values that can be used to represent the data element. A value domain has a data type (e.g. Boolean, decimal and integer) and, optionally, a minimum length, a maximum length and a decimal precision. A value domain can be enumerated (specified through a list of values of a least two individual permissible values) or non-enumerated. For example, the Customer Preferred Language is represented by a list of language codes from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 639-1:2002).

<p>
Data quality is affected by the way data are entered, stored and managed. Maintaining data quality requires going through the data periodically and scrubbing it. Typically this involves updating, standardizing, and de-duplicating records to create a single view of the data, even if it is stored in multiple disparate systems. Data quality control  or assurance  (DQA) is the process of verifying the reliability and effectiveness of data through a set of Data Quality Rules.Data Quality Controls can be preventive, detective, or recovery in nature. They can also be designed to apply to a single record, or to many records in a process.

<p>Derived data elements (also called complex data elements) are a special grouping of data elements. They represent the results of computational operations performed on other data elements and have a derivation type (e.g. Calculated, Concatenation and Compound).
Derived data elements are not collected, but are defined so that once a transmission/extract is received a new data element can be derived. For example, if ""Customer Date of Birth"" is part of a transmission/extract, ""Customer Age"" can then be calculated. For example, the input data elements ""First Name"", ""Middle Name"" and ""Family Name"" might be aggregated together to form the compound data element ""Full Name"".
The computations may involve algorithms supported by two or more data elements within a single entity instance or algorithms summarizing data element values across multiple entity instances within a single entity or across multiple entities.

<summary id="llm-attention:datasciencedojo">**LLM Attention** - Source: `datasciencedojo`</summary>
<p>
Attention mechanisms in LLMs, particularly the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, allow the model to weigh the importance of different words or phrases.
By assigning different weights to the tokens in the input sequence, the model can focus on the most relevant information while ignoring less important details.
This ability to selectively focus on specific parts of the input is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies and understanding the nuances of natural language.
</p></details>
<summary id="llm-embedding:datasciencedojo">**LLM Embedding** - Source: `datasciencedojo`</summary>
<p>
Embeddings are continuous vector representations of words or tokens that capture their semantic meanings in a high-dimensional space.
They allow the model to convert discrete tokens into a format that can be processed by the neural network.
LLMs learn embeddings during training to capture relationships between words, like synonyms or analogies.
</p></details>
<summary id="llm-tokenization:datasciencedojo">**LLM Pre Training** - Source: `datasciencedojo`</summary>
<p>
Pre-training is the process of training an LLM on a large dataset, usually unsupervised or self-supervised, before fine-tuning it for a specific task.
During pretraining, the model learns general language patterns, relationships between words, and other foundational knowledge.
</p></details>
<summary id="llm-tokenization:datasciencedojo">**LLM Tokenization** - Source: `datasciencedojo`</summary>
<p>
Tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of text into individual words, subwords, or tokens that the model can understand.
LLMs use subword algorithms like BPE or wordpiece to split text into smaller units that capture common and uncommon words.
This approach helps to limit the model’s vocabulary size while maintaining its ability to represent any text sequence.
</p></details>
<summary id="llm-tokenization:datasciencedojo">**LLM Transfer learning** - Source: `datasciencedojo`</summary>
<p>
Transfer learning is the technique of leveraging the knowledge gained during pretraining and applying it to a new, related task. In the context of LLMs, transfer learning involves fine-tuning a pretrained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset to achieve high performance on that task.
The benefit of transfer learning is that it allows the model to benefit from the vast amount of general language knowledge learned during pretraining, reducing the need for large labeled datasets and extensive training for each new task.
